✨This Repo introduces/welcomes me to the “Deep Dive into JavaScript” project on AlxAfrica!✨
In this project, I will develop a user registration form with validation and fetch user data from a public API.
This project will enhance my understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

By the end of this project, I will learn how to:
✨Validate form inputs using JavaScript.
✨Dynamically interact with HTML elements.
✨Fetch and display data from a public API.
✨Provide real-time feedback to users.

✨By the end of this project, I shall have a solid understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications applyin all what I have learnt✨
